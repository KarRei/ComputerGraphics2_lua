lua terminal will open, from there the following commands can be run:
whatObjects() : lists the objects declared in the file
cameraParams() : lists the camera parameters declared in the file
directions() : lists the D-, U- and R-direction vectors of the camera
frustum() : lists the camera-frustum vertices and normals
